## 'Intermediate' Front End Development Projects from the FCC Curriculum

In order to complete the projects described in this section, a series of bonfire challenges needed to be passed. The topics that these covered included:

- HTML5 and CSS
- Responsive Design with Bootstrap
- Introduction to jQuery
- Basic Javascript
- Introduction to Object Oriented and Functional Programming
- Basic Algorithm Scripting
- Introduction to JSON API's and AJAX

These can be seen on my [FCC profile][52abe933]

In total there were 4 projects, each came with their own user stories (describe below).

**Use the Twitchtv JSON API**

- User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

- User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

- User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

- User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

**NOTE**

This was at the very beginning of my programming journey, so the projects are very limited. I've decided to present them as a reference for how much I have developed since. Other repositories listed on my profile showcase this.
